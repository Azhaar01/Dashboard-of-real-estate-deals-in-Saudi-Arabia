I developed a dynamic dashboard using Microsoft Power BI Called:
# **real estate deals in Saudi Arabia during the third quarter of 2023**

The project aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of real estate transactions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the third quarter of 2023.
Through the dynamic dashboard I developed, interested individuals can access detailed information about real estate transactions in various neighborhoods in each city, including property size and related prices.
This enables them to make informed and logical investment decisions.

The dashboard contains:

2 Donut charts, the first displays the total number of properties by property classification and the other by property type

2 stacked bar charts, the first showing total area by neighborhood and containing a card containing total area, and the second displaying average prices by neighborhood and containing a card containing average prices.

A table containing the city, neighborhood, average prices, total area, and total number of properties by month

A map containing the total number of properties by region

3 cards containing the number of neighborhoods, estates and cities

1 Slicer allows the user to search in the city and neighborhood in which he wants to know the status of real estate
