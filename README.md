I developed a dynamic dashboard using Microsoft Power BI Called:
# **real estate deals in Saudi Arabia during the third quarter of 2023**

The project aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of real estate transactions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the third quarter of 2023.
Through the dynamic dashboard I developed, interested individuals can access detailed information about real estate transactions in various neighborhoods in each city, including property size and related prices.
This enables them to make informed and logical investment decisions.
